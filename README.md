# Connect 3 Game

Welcome to the Connect 3 Game! This project is a simple console-based implementation of the Connect 3 game, similar to the popular Connect 4 game but with a smaller grid. Players take turns to drop their tokens into the grid, and the first player to align three tokens vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins.

## Features

- **Two-player gameplay**: Play against a friend in a turn-based manner.
- **Dynamic grid**: The game features a dynamic grid where players can place their tokens.
- **Win detection**: The game automatically detects and announces the winner when a player aligns three tokens.
- **Input validation**: Ensures that players input valid moves within the grid boundaries.

## How to Play

1. **Start the game**: Run the program in a C compiler or an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports C.
2. **Take turns**: Players take turns to enter the column number where they want to drop their token.
3. **Win the game**: The first player to align three tokens vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.
